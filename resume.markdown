achieveable grade The degrees I earned at Munich School of Philosophy, Humboldt University Berlin and the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy were graded on this scale.
- At Imperial College, degrees were classified in one of the three categories "Pass", "Merit", "Distinction", with Distinction being the best achievable classification.
- At UC Berkeley, the best achievable GPA was 4.0
