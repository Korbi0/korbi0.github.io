 The following is one of my favorite poems. 
 
 It may not be exactly true,
 but the way I remember my history with it is that my mom recited it to me
 just once when I was a child, but it immediately burned itself into my
 memory. To this day I think about it every once in a while.

A brief google search has not turned up any translation into English that 
I felt really captured what I like about it, so here's my own attempt.

First, the German original:

>Rudern zwei  
>ein boot,  
>der eine  
>kundig der sterne,  
>der andre  
>kundig der st端rme,  
>wird der eine  
>f端hrn durch die sterne  
>wird der andre  
>f端hrn durch die st端rme  
>und am ende ganz am ende  
>wird das meer in der erinnerung  
>blau sein.  
>(**Reiner Kunze**)


And my translation:

>Two  
>are rowing a boat,  
>one  
>knowledgeable of stars,  
>the other  
>knowledgeable of storms,    
>will the one  
>guide through the stars  
>will the other  
>guide through the storms  
>and in the end  
>in the very end  
>the sea will be blue in memory.
