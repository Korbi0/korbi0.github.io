I am a PhD Student in Philosophy at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

Before starting my PhD in the fall of 2023, I worked as an A.I. researcher at SETLabs Research GmbH,
where my occupation was to improve deep learning based Camera-LiDAr sensor
fusion for autonomously driving trains in a manner that is mindful
of explainability.

Before that, I studied Philosophy, Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence
in Munich, Berlin, Berkeley and London.


I am interested in a range of areas within Philosophy, and have in the past
enjoyed reading and writing on Phenomenology, Aesthetics, Virtue Ethics, 
Wittgenstein and Nietzsche.
In my most recent MA at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy,
I focused on modal and non-classical logic(s) as well as social choice
and behavioral judgement aggregation.

In my PhD, I am working on Social Epistemology, Social Choice and Political Philosophy.
In particular, I am interested in the role prediction markets can play in areas
of cooperative investigation and decision making.
