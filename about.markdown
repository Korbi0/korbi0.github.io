I'm starting a PhD in Philosophy at LSE in the fall of 2023.

Previously, I worked as an A.I. researcher at SETlabs Research GmbH,
where my occupation was to improve deep learning based Camera-LiDAr sensor
fusion for autonomously driving trains in a manner that is mindful
of explainability.

Before that, I studied Philosophy, Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence
in Munich, Berlin, Berkeley and London.


I am interested in a range of areas within Philosophy, and have in the past
enjoyed reading and writing on Phenomenology, Aesthetics, Virtue Ethics, 
Wittgenstein and Nietzsche.
In my most recent MA at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy,
I focussed on modal and non-classical logic(s) as well as social choice
and behavioral judgement aggregation.
