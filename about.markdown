I'm starting a PhD in Philosophy at LSE this fall.

Right now I work as an A.I. researcher at SETlabs Research GmbH, where my occupation is to improve deep learning based Camera-LiDAR sensor fusion for autonomously driving trains in a manner that is mindful of explainability.

I studied Philosophy, Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence in Munich, Berlin, Berkeley and London.

I am interested in a range of areas within Philosophy, and have in the past enjoyed reading and writing on Phenomenology, Aesthetics, Virtue Ethics, Wittgenstein and Nietzsche. In my most recent MA at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy, I focussed on modal and non-classical logic(s) as well as social choice and behavioral judgement aggregation.
